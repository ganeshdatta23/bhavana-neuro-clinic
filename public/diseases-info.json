            "clinical_overview": "Headaches and migraines represent a broad spectrum of neurological dysfunction. While primary headaches like tension-type headaches are common, migraines are a distinct neurological disease involving the trigeminal nerve system. Migraine pathophysiology involves 'Cortical Spreading Depression' (CSD), where a wave of electrophysiological activity moves across the cortex, followed by the release of inflammatory substances like Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP). Chronic migraines affect approximately 15% of the global population and are classified as a leading cause of disability. Unlike standard headaches, migraines are often accompanied by 'central sensitization,' where the brain becomes hyper-reactive to normal sensory input, leading to allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli like brushing hair). Treatment involves a balance of acute 'triptans' and preventative lifestyle modifications.",

Ischemic strokes (87% of cases) involve a thrombus or embolus blocking an artery. Hemorrhagic strokes involve the rupture of a weakened vessel (aneurysm). Paralysis (hemiplegia) occurs because the primary motor cortex in the brain is damaged; since the brain's wiring crosses over in the medulla, a left-brain stroke causes right-sided paralysis. The 'Golden Hour' is the first 60 minutes after symptom onset; receiving thrombolytic 'clot-busting' drugs (tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy during this window can prevent permanent paralysis and save millions of neurons.",

This activity can be localized (focal) or involve the entire brain (generalized). It is not a single disease but a symptom of underlying neurological dysfunction which could be genetic, structural (scar tissue from injury), or metabolic.

It is categorized into Peripheral Vertigo (inner ear issues like BPPV) and Central Vertigo (brainstem or cerebellar issues). The most common cause, Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), occurs when calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) shift into the semi-circular canals of the ear.

Parkinson's is not just a movement disorder; it is a multi-systemic disease that involves the gut (enteric nervous system) and the olfactory system (smell) years before tremors begin.
